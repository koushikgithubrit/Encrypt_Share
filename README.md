Project details:
1. Effortlessly upload your files up to 100 GB and receive a secret code to securely share your data with
multiple recipients.
2. When the recipient enters the secret code, the uploaded data is directly transferred and stored on their
device, ensuring efficient and private sharing.
3. The platform ensures secure data transfers without storing files on a central server, providing both security
and convenience for large file sharing.
